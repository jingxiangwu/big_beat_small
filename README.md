# Tiny examples of machine learning techniques
This is a collection of interesting examples using tensorflow and ideas from machine learnng to tackle small tasks.

- Minimization of a given function using Tensorflow
  * techniques to avoid local minima. A protypical example is to find the global minimum of Rastrigin function
- Finding an approximate solution to differential equations subject to a given initial value
